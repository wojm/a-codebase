# Vim
Command line text editor. Doesn't allow drag-and-drop. Great for editing code remotely. Occasionally good for editing locally, but somewhat cumberesome.
```
vim <filename>
```
Since vim doesn't have a click interface, it has a meta state that allows for macros. 
 - To entere insertion, type i.
 - To enter meta, hit escape
   - To save and quit type `:wq`
   - To save, type `:w`
   - To quit without saving, type `:q!`
