# Python

Python is an interpreted, high-level, general-purpose programming language.
 - interpreted:     run step-by-step (as opposed to compiled)
 - high-level:      takes care of tricky details, but not optimized
 - general-purpose: can be used for a wide range of applications and put onto many devices

## Motivation
Python 

## Setup

### Install Python
Visit the website
https://www.python.org/downloads/

Verify by going to your terminal application (or GitBash) and type:
```
python --version
```
You should see a version that start with a 3. A google search with the phrase `uprade python mac` or `upgrade python windows` or `upgrade python linux` should provide upgrade instructions.

## Execution
To execute, type:
```
python main.py
```

## Shell
We can also also open up a python shell to execute python code. This is similar to terminal in that terminal was a bash shell. A python shell will also execute code line by line
